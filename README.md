# MQTT client with idiomatic asyncio interface

Write code like this:

```python
async with Client('test.mosquitto.org') as client:
    await client.subscribe('floors/#')

    async with client.filtered_messages('floors/+/humidity') as messages:
        async for message in messages:
            print(message.decode())
```

* No more callbacks! üëç
* No more return codes (welcome to the `MqttError`)
* Graceful disconnection (forget about `on_unsubscribe`, `on_disconnect`, etc.)
* Compatible with `async` code
* Did we mention no more callbacks?

We combine the stability of the time-proven [paho-mqtt](https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.python) library with a modern, asyncio-based interface.

The whole thing is less than [250 lines of code](https://github.com/sbtinstruments/asyncio-mqtt/blob/master/asyncio_mqtt/client.py).
