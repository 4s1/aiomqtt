# Publishing and subscribing

Let's see a minimal working example of publishing a message:

```python
import asyncio
import asyncio_mqtt as aiomqtt


async def main():
    async with aiomqtt.Client("test.mosquitto.org") as client:
        await client.publish("humidity/outside", payload=0.38)


asyncio.run(main())
```

For subscribing and listening to messages, a minimal working example looks like this:

```python
import asyncio
import asyncio_mqtt as aiomqtt


async def main():
    async with aiomqtt.Client("test.mosquitto.org") as client:
        async with client.messages() as messages:
            await client.subscribe("humidity/#")
            async for message in messages:
                print(message.payload)


asyncio.run(main())
```

## Payload encoding

MQTT message payloads are transmitted as byte streams.

asyncio-mqtt accepts payloads of types `int`, `float`, `str`, `bytes`, `bytearray`, and `None`. `int` and `float` payloads are automatically converted to `str` (which is then converted to `bytes`). If you want to send a true `int` or `float`, you can use [`struct.pack()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html) to encode it as a `bytes` object. When no payload is specified or when it's set to `None`, a zero-length payload is sent.

```{important}
If you want to send non-standard types, you have to implement the encoding yourself. For example, to send a `dict` as JSON, you can use `json.dumps()` (which returns a `str`). On the receiving end, you can then use `json.loads()` to decode the JSON string back into a `dict`.
```

## Quality of Service (QoS)

MQTT messages can be sent with different levels of reliability. When publishing a message and when subscribing to a topic you can set the `qos` parameter to one of the three Quality of Service levels:

- QoS 0 (**"At most once"**): The message is sent once, with no guarantee of delivery. This is the fastest and least reliable option. This is the default of asyncio-mqtt.
- QoS 1 (**"At least once"**): The message is delivered at least once to the receiver, possibly multiple times. The sender stores messages until the receiver acknowledges receipt.
- QoS 2 (**"Exactly once"**): The message is delivered exactly once to the receiver, guaranteed through a four-part handshake. This is the slowest and most reliable option.

```{important}
The QoS levels of the publisher and the subscriber are two different things and don't have to be the same!

The publisher's QoS level defines the reliability of the communication between the publisher and the broker. The subscriber's QoS level defines the reliability of the communication between the broker and the subscriber.
```

## Persistent sessions

Connections to the MQTT broker can be persistent or non-persistent. Persistent sessions are kept alive when the client is offline. This means that the broker stores the client's subscriptions and any messages of QoS 1 and 2 that the client misses or has not yet acknowledged. The broker will then retransmit the messages when the client reconnects.

Session persistence is set when connecting to the broker. To create a persistent session, set the `clean_session` parameter to `False` when creating the client. For a non-persistent session, set `clean_session` to `True`.

```{note}
The amount of messages that can be queued is limited by the broker's memory. If a client with a persistent session does not come back online for a long time, the broker will eventually run out of memory and start discarding messages.
```

## Retained messages

Messages can be published with the `retain` parameter set to `True`. The broker relays these messages to all subscribers as usual but also stores the most recent message for the topic. Each new subscriber receives the last retained message for a topic immediately after they subscribe. This can be useful for sending the last good value to a new subscriber without them needing to wait for the next published message.

```{important}
The broker stores only one retained message per topic. If you publish a new retained message on a topic, the previous retained message is overwritten.
```

```{note}
To delete a retained message, simply send a message with zero payload to the topic. However, itâ€™s usually not necessary to delete retained messages, as new retained messages overwrite the previous ones.
```

## Filtering messages

Imagine you're measuring temperature and humidity on the outside and inside, and our topics look like this: `temperature/outside`. You want to receive all types of measurements but handle them differently.

asyncio-mqtt provides `Topic.matches()` to make this easy:

```python
import asyncio
import asyncio_mqtt as aiomqtt


async def main():
    async with aiomqtt.Client("test.mosquitto.org") as client:
        async with client.messages() as messages:
            await client.subscribe("#")
            async for message in messages:
                if message.topic.matches("humidity/outside"):
                    print(f"[humidity/outside] {message.payload}")
                if message.topic.matches("+/inside"):
                    print(f"[+/inside] {message.payload}")
                if message.topic.matches("temperature/#"):
                    print(f"[temperature/#] {message.payload}")


asyncio.run(main())
```

```{note}
In our example, messages to `temperature/inside` are handled twice!
```
